# stats220

This is my repo for STATS 220. 

A little about me:

- I am undertaking a degree in Computer Science
- I am taking STATS 220 because I want to explore what useful things we can do with data and how we can use it to solve problems.
- I am interested in learning about data technologies and how I can incorporate them into my Computer Science studies.

A meme that captures how I currently feel about my university studies is ![](https://c.tenor.com/8druEACXtX8AAAAd/tenor.gif)
