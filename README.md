# STATS 220

## This is my repo for *STATS 220*. 

### A little about me:

- I am undertaking a degree in **Computer Science**
- I am taking STATS 220 because I want to explore useful **applications of data** and how we can use it to solve real-world problems.
  
### In STATS 220, I am interested in:
1. learning about [data technologies](https://www.datamation.com/big-data/big-data-technologies/)
2. incorporating data-driven solutions into my Computer Science studies

### A meme that captures how I currently feel about my university studies:
